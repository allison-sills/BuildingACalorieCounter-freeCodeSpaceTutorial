<h1>Project Overview</h1>

This project was created using FreeCodeCamp's free JavaScript tutorial. The purpose of this exercise is to practice form validation and enhance JavaScript skills by:
<ul>
<li>Validating user inputs</li>
<li>Performing calculations based on inputs</li>
<li>Dynamically updating the interface to display results</li>
</ul>
The tutorial covers key JavaScript concepts such as template literals and methods like `addEventListener()`.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>User Input Validation: Ensures all user inputs are valid before processing.</li>
<li>Calorie Tracking: Users can input calories consumed for each meal of the day and calories burned from exercise.</li>
<li>Target Calories: Users can set their target calorie intake for the day.</li>
<li>Calorie Deficit/Surplus Calculation: Calculates and displays the calorie deficit or surplus based on user inputs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Annotations</h2>
In addition to following the tutorial, I have included my own detailed annotations for the tutorial code to provide deeper insights and explanations.
